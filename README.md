# Kate Lenart's Portfolio - Advanced GIS, Spring 2020

### About me

She/her/hers

I am a second-year PPM student with an interest in policy analysis and program evaluation. Prior to coming to Heinz, I studied history, economics, and business at Villanova (go Wildcats!) before going to University of Delaware for my Master's in history. While there, my research focused on popular culture and social movements during the 20th century. After graduating, I worked in the archives and object collections of a historical society and a public health association.

I had originally become interested in policy development and analysis through my museum studies coursework at Delaware. I had worked with five other students to draft and help pass legislation to address issues that museums and other entities faced regarding abandoned cultural property, which refers to objects that are in a museum's possession but that the museum does not have legal title to. This resulted in a lasting interest in developing evidence-based policy solutions and evaluating current policies, which ultimately led me to Heinz.

This summer, I worked at the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the Financial Markets and Community Investment team. I plan to continue working in policy analysis and program evaluation following graduation.

### What I hope to learn

While I am looking forward to further developing my skills in ArcGIS Pro during this course, I am very interested in learning about alternative mapping tools that I could use at organizations that do not subscribe to ArcGIS software, including Mapbox. I am also hoping to learn more about recommended procedures for managing GIS projects from start to finish so that I can develop a standardized workflow that will assist me in future work. My current internship includes mapping responsibilities, and I sometimess make multiple iterations of several maps based on new information or client feedback. Having a set procedure for approaching these types of projects would be helpful to make sure that I have all project elements properly arranged and documented to pass on to the client.
